# LightO

LightO is an open remote-controlled light project.

The project is based around an ESP32 driving a string of addressable LEDs, in this case a custom PCB with 61 SK6812 RGBW LEDs.

The user is able to control the LightO through an intuitive web-based interface, consisting of basic color-wheel and slider control.

The light is powered by a single USB-C port. 
The brightness of the light is user-controlled and can be driven at up to roughly 15 W, for an eye-scorching brightness level.
